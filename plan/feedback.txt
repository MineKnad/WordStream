Sentiment tab -> the group (Feedback on tuwel) was not well received, too basic and sentiment is red/blue -> quite confusing and has nothing to do with the original wordstream

Add a bit more to it -> project can be interesting but needs to be sufficient

Dataset we want to add is probably already there, find a very cool dataset 

Sentiment Analysis -> maybe a happy score instead of "good/bad" or emotions or something else, more creative
Important: Better way to do sentiment analysis
Language Model in this regard -> maybe better, can this make sense?

Individual panel between the word "war" for example, see how the sentiment has evolved
common words, so importance 

Wordstream -> are always about the given datasets, maybe give users the possibility to uploadtheir own documents
Can this be done? How?

Keep the solution clean and uncluttered
